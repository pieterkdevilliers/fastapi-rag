7 Questions To Ask Your Shutter Company Before You Buy
So, you’ve decided to buy window shutters. We commend your choice! But who to buy them from? What makes a good shutter company, and what should you aim to avoid?
(Hint: If you’re looking for a fantastic shutter company in Scotland, look no further!)
Here are 7 questions to ask potential shutter company contenders before you commit.
1 – What’s Your Experience?
Top of the list when you’re hunting down a reputable shutter company is their experience in the field. That’s because fitting shutters is a specialism, one that requires expert knowledge and professional finesse.
Having been in the industry for over 37 years, SSC – Scotland’s #1 shutter company – has encountered every conceivable challenge of fitting shutters of all shapes and sizes. From wonky window frames to awkwardly shaped windows, there is
always
a solution, and we’re the ones to find it.
Years of experience means we are proficiently adept at what we do and are proud to admit it.
2 – Can I See Your Products?
We love online shopping, don’t we? It’s so easy. With a couple of clicks, you can get pretty much anything you want or need delivered straight to your door, making it easy to fit your modern consumerist habit into daily life.
Buying online also makes it simple to compare products and services at face value, removing the need to trail around different shops in varying locations. But when you’re investing in shutters, nothing compares to seeing them in person.
Shutters are an investment that lasts years upon years, even enhancing the value of your house. You’ll live with them for the next decade, so getting eyes on them before purchasing is an invaluable part of the buying journey.
And not all shutters are the same! There are different ranges to consider, not to mention colours and materials. When you see them in the flesh, you can make sure they fit your taste, experience how easily they operate, and even look at how motorised shutters work.
As the favourite shutter company in Scotland, we understand that customers need to see what they’re investing in before they part with their hard-earned money. That’s why we built our huge showrooms full of shutters on display…

3 – What Is Your Guarantee Length?
How many times have you bought something that goes wrong just over a year old, only to discover it will cost you for repair?
When you buy a product designed to last a decade, you want to know that it has a decent guarantee, just in case. Guarantees vary across the sector, so do your homework before you commit to buying.
Looking for a trusted shutter company in Scotland? SSC offers a no-nonsense guarantee of between 3 and 5 years, depending on the product.
4 – What If I Have A Problem?
There’s nothing worse than not being able to get in touch with your expert when you need them especially if you’ve forked out a ton of money to buy their product and get them to fit it.
If something happens to your SSC shutters and you need help, call us! We’ll work with you to find a solution so that you’re not left in a pickle. After all, we’re the most customer-focused shutter company in Scotland!
5 – Are You A Member Of A Professional Body?
This is a great question to ask any business you’re considering. Being a member of the BBSA, or the British Blind and Shutter Association, means they must adhere to high industry standards, which is a strong sign of a reputable shutter company.
BBSA members are also:
Fully insured
Committed to training
Committed to child safety
Up to date with regulations and best practices.
In Scotland at SCC, our very own Director, David, is currently serving as President of the regulatory body so that you can be fully assured of our compliance!
6 – Who Measures And Fits Them?
SSC is Scotland’s most well-known shutter company, and our clients have plenty of wonderful things to say about our service and products.
So much can go wrong doing it the DIY way. If one measurement is even a millimetre out, the whole set of shutters can be rendered completely useless… A huge waste of time and money.
If you are looking at shutters, a company that takes the time to measure up for you and come back to carry out pro installation is the best route. And that’s what we do. This way, we can ensure there is no damage to window frames, walls or the shutters themselves.
A professional fit also means your sparkly new shutters will last without coming loose or wobbling. (And it keeps them protected under the guarantee, too).
7 – Can I Read Reviews & Case Studies?
There’s nothing more telling about a shutter company than the experience of others.
Read any reviews you can get your hands on: social media, review websites and the shutter company’s website.
You can also ask a business to speak to some past customers directly if you want to hear from the horse’s mouth; most reputable shutter businesses will have clients on their books who are happy to have a quick phone call.
A word of warning. Don’t immediately dismiss a shutter company if you read a negative review. Review the response, ask the company about the review and make a judgment call.
But if you’re finding loads of bad reviews everywhere you look? RUN!
Finding A Shutter Company In Scotland Is Easy
(Just choose us!)
Just kidding. You’ve got to make sure the shutter company you choose is the right one for you.
These 7 questions will help you filter the most attentive and reliable shutter company for your purchase. They will ensure you have beautiful shutters and a millimetre-perfect fit for maximised durability and longevity.
