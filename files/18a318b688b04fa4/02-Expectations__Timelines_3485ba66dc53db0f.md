The marketing team itself has a lot of strength in the individuals that are there. And our parent, clear Haven, has funded one of their operating partners who is a marketing expert to support us two days a week for the next several months as part of helping us drive interim leadership and also ramp of the new individual. And so the first, call it the first 90 days of the new person coming on board, I would expect there's a lot of learning that happens, but the key thing is making sure that we start to see acceleration in key areas of the execution that we're running on. I don't think we need to, well, I don't ever want to say we shouldn't change because there's absolute change as always a benefit. But because we have strong individuals who are making progress in a number of areas, but the opportunity is how do we narrow focus if needed, drive acceleration if possible in that first three to six months, and then longer term, as we look at where we can invest more, right? Because in the current economic conditions with the current economic environment, we're aiming to be very scrappy and not look to scale the organisation. But when it's time to scale, then understanding where do we get the best value for incremental dollars spent organizationally and with programme spend to be able to drive acceleration. So that's in the six to 12 month range, is really understanding where and how we consider scaling the organisation if the financial environment supports it.
